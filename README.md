# sequelizedBurger
This app is all about eating hamburgers. Simply add your favorite hamburger into the field that says "Burger Name" and then you can "Devour" your favorite burger.

##Description
This app demonstrates a simple full stack, single page web app with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from the Materialize framework. The backend is implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done using Handlebars. All burger data is stored in a mySQL database and manipulated with sequelize. 

Users are able to create any burger they choose and add it to the database. Once the burger is added to the menu the user can either choose to "Devour" their custom burger or "Devour" somebody a previously added burger. If a burger has already been devoured the user can choose to "EAT THIS BURGER AGAIN!" and the burger moves back into the original column and can be eaten again.
